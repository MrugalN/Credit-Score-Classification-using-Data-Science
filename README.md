# Credit-Score-Classification-using-Data-Science
• Developed a high-performing Decision Tree model (84.07% accuracy) for a finance company, automating credit score categorization (High Risk, Low Risk) and reducing manual efforts.

About the dataset 

1.1. Problem Statement 

Over the years, a global finance company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce the manual efforts. In terms of business value, we would like to know what each customer's credit classification is based on the desired variables. Based on our dataset, we are classifying what ‘credit score’ each customer has based on the other variables such as number of bank accounts, interest rate, annual income, outstanding debt, etc. 

1.2. Task (business questions?) 

Given a person’s credit-related information, build a machine learning model that can classify the credit score into categories of ‘Bad’, ‘Standard’ and ‘Good’.
